questions at every touch Point are you getting you are getting your proper recommendations similarly uh best pricing About Properties when you try buying you want to have respects and ideally organize and uh it's a good product good quality product and you're able to get it the then uh in continuing the selection the informational products that are similar utility uh like the uh so that will help you to make an informal decision about that professor are you getting that kind of information do you have access to a large Corpus of user reviews before making a purchase we want to take that product which has positive requests and possibly rated highest and there are also a few I mean ideally if there are a few pairs how is it working and if somebody is saying the product was generated so do you have access to that kind of information and again some information from the platform on sale events compatible so these are typical uh again customer expectations continuing with that in terms of delivery there has to be predictability when it says that it will deliver in certain number of days is it delivery contact and is the delivery experience the person who comes to deliver to you is seller and you know painfully see uh there are certain customer touch points which which is like a handshake to the government it could be the home page purchase experience delivery experience and the return experience these have to be under call center interaction these are the things so in fact we don't know any other point within the company where you can interact these are the places you interact with and if the experience is good you are happy otherwise you you you tend to be that you know the company is not responding to them that kind of information so these are expectations similarly conveying experiences from multiple channels and the channel to share and see with your customer experience raise complaints that could be redressed and do we have an active Channel where you can interact with the company for example you are trying to search for something you're not getting engaged you want to communicate with the company that why is it happening so is it such possibilities are there these are the things a typical customer would expect for a platform these are indicative not exhaustive it all depends on the kind of platform that you are interacting with the kind of uh items that are up for sale so what is broadly covers the entire piece let us look at organizational quotations this is a different view like two sides of the guy and category organization typically wants a good customer experience at every customer that's why once the customer is happy he would come to the platform again and again and why you can so he wants to ensure that these things happen and there is a good conversion so typically most companies uh people may be out of n people may be Point say point zero one percent people only nearly convert that means they're the only point so most of the people look at the items maybe add to God they want to compare with other products different products in the different platforms is the price lower somewhere else and that kind of comparison you do and at times it's also like now I'm free let me look at I want to buy in some time let me look at different products that are up for sale and I mean then why do the people doing it and can we do something from the data says point of view is there any model that can help you and a good conversion uh as I said and optimal selection category to all cancer so each of us have our own price point and for different technicians possibly we'll spend different amount of money for example for the daily use possibly you do not want to spend too much money whereas an application otherwise we use you don't mind spending more money and and also each of us are price sensitive to some extent and are in sensitive so for me is the catering to my requirements is it giving me on test selection that is available and uh that's what organization expects am I able to get it to all customers and and the easy day curated platform where customers are happy to see and tell information that you have for example you would have seen from the platform to platform you think it's very inserted platforms when you try to look at that every information about a virtual product is completely available in some places they are not available invest and fine Revenue generating opportunities like ads in addition to sale and profit that they might make are there any opportunities Avenues to generate some money for the company and uh again these are the background models that were uh in addition to uh what what is provided to the customer it could be is the catalog hygiene for example imagine a power bank and imagine is imported from a certain company you might have seen often that our power bank or you can see mobile cover when you try to look for a mobile cover RN RF stand you would see exactly same product with the different names price is also different okay that's a kind of a bad customer experience ideally there should have been collapsed under say called one ticket in single vertical give it a straight multiple products there they don't you don't want to see so many exactly same items in different things wants to get onboarded is he able to get onboarded easily so that is the other thing and can data says help in automatic current Network for example imagine a case of lipstick okay lipstick broadly Beauty and personality and kind of a camera in fact the cattle of hierarchy you can see when you search for a particular product on any platform any of these platform popular platforms you can see that entire header it is possible that when it is manually uh you know onboarded but the quality is on board it is possible that same logistic may be available under say a duty infrastructure okay or also possibly all the products under uh foreign again I would go to refrigerator which does not require maintenance for about five years it's a very long sentence that easily able to figure out what is that is there in customer life and figure out that then it will show that kind of thing our most popular uh of 558 class when we do that kind of queries is it able to show the right products and again prevent platform for exploitation so there are a lot of fraud uh keeps happening on these e-commerce I mean can we prevent a buyer or a seller you know waiting or exploiting the platform so we'll discuss about making more detail as we progress but organization expects these type of things to happen optimal and app notifications again you would look at notification the sale today have you missed out are are something you left in your cart this kind of message you may be seen from different platforms sometimes they'll be irritating when they come through frequently so that's where the optimal notification and every customer has to get the right kind of information can it be personalized whether the content also sometimes it messages themselves to be irritating it's not very respectful it's like ideally they won't excite you but it doesn't matter to all kinds of questions and similarly shading customer Behavior can we how do we make engage the customer as he makes the purchase similarly how do you ensure that his uh he comes back again then optimal inventory procurement way to procure what to produce at what instances how frequently where do you store how do you which warehouses you should store across India how they should be distributed how they should be moving from one bedroom when they should go where is the demand and again optimal inbound and outward supply chain you think it is a very low rate uh optimization when are the items are getting uh moving out where is that Tipping Point then this is the point and we need to immediately replace we should go to the buy-in and buy them and store their products similarly optimal sr2 what combination of items you should have like how many battery packs like you cannot overfill uh uh again demand predictions in immediate term medium term and long term and optimal delivery like I cannot use too many daily agents to deliver because in apartment complex I may sending suppose every let us say that number let's say that I mean it's not 10 is the right number but that is not the right number but I'll give you an example imagine even delivery it has to deliver 10 productivity and uh there are 100 deliveries but all 100 deliveries are going to an apartment complex again personalized liquidations provide platform for receiving customer feedback through multi multimedia like it will be text that is an awesome product and I bought a camera I will say the pixels are actually awesome and this is God and I have a bedroom of size 10 by 12 and I would like to share the photo of the car inside my house so typically those things will uh chime well with the clients with the customer so typically most of us may have the 10 by 12 kind of bedroom and we want to see whether that kind of a record will fit into my place well doing that it is possible that some images uh have a picture so we need to filter them we need to use computational algorithm to say that the packet is perpendicularly text while they are saying when they are when they express when they are too unhappy they may use expletives that we need to see that two sticks are not there at the same and and again video or supposing the company also encourages videos to be uploaded again they have to be cleaned up and see that they are proper videos again mechanisms to address analyze and address customer feedback that was customer feedback first of all data to platform where they have this in a handshake they should be able to get the more and more they get the customer feedback they become more you know better for example supposing car hiding cab hiding companies uh you are kind of you know you and how can we do that in an automated process let us let me talk about uh data says ecosystem a large sales company the large is in terms of the catalog how many items they are selling maybe millions of items they're selling and meaning I remember again it's a broad to indicate large and taking videos anymore we'll have at least about 100 solutions that are actively working at any point that kind of problems yeah another thing is how these problems come from who will Define these problems they can be defined by anybody and most of it they are driven by the business directions what is that you want for example you decide that I want to cater to uh customers who do not want who cannot spend much money there are a lot of people uh who do not want to spend good money I want to capture that kind of position or I want to go to tier 2 tier 3 cities okay this is the business directions you brought me you have and they would say if I have to go to pediatricity what data has to do how can you help me to you know generate right recommendations these are all typical broad statements will be broadly like this they will be very very uh a kind of ill-defined at very broad sense then a data scientist job needs to convert them into formal management statements and solve them and most often it happens something like when my first problem in one of the e-commerce companies that I worked earlier is uh like uh addresses are killing us can you do something about it so you need to figure out what is addressed what is healing you need to go you know you need to run the extra mile maybe physically visit your weird houses delivery houses and see what is happening then you figure out okay this is the problem maybe we need to bring some automation there and then you figure out what should be the pattern what should the kitchen audience so most often these are the problems and sometimes it may be again I was talking about conversion in September year there are a number of computer platforms they don't buy and move away what is it we can do about it so these things are loaded questions then we need to see and we have access to the customer's previous purchases and obviously behaving on the platform based on that can be taken in competitions and why why a customer is not buying or is simply browsing and going back is it that we are not able to show the right product to them or the price is higher or completing competition is leaving at lower price or their delivery experience is better returns are handling better so these are some of the questions and tries to analyze the data then come to the conclusion and go back and explain it and ideally the data science team cannot work in isolation this is one one kind of a thing that one should avoid but that's one tendency to move data scientists where they try to work in isolation they want to solve the problem they are the main experts they want to see that let me equally time and that's me don't touch me for some time it doesn't happen that way you need to interact with business product and Engineering teams very active you need to create those bridges and understand each other see there by pain points in fact no data science model is complete and accurate without including the domain knowledge the domain knowledge is in the head of that popular operations person or a business person so when you talk to them only they know that it is the language that you do for example when you want to optimize the function nobody will tell you okay maximum Revenue subject in that conditional conditions this is something that you need to figure out information but they will tell you all the main points that that you have to internalize them listen to them actually ask questions when you don't understand then think over and complete your former mathematical statement and difficult days starts with this big problem statement then try to figure out what you can do about it maybe you need to understand the data play with the data see what is happening then you figure out because this is the problem maybe I need to solve it in this particular manner once you think over in your mind and consolidate that and you could take some days some days few weeks before you come to this stage then you go back to the person who was talking about this problem it would be business by product people go back to them and say that this is what I'm trying to solve and this is a metric of the solving which this is not really is it good enough what do you think even [Music] then if you have to deploy what is the time available and it is supposed to be in the real-time deployment it has a real-time deployment typically requires your Computing time of something like anything much lower depends on what other uh engineering deployment happened in Canada if it has to be shown to the customer there are secrets or payments that happen each of them will take its finite plan all time slicing together is it sufficient uh if not again you have to hear that the type of model vintages you have to be conscious about that and choose that model which will fit for this kind of completely foreign is respected for its complexity and try solving them for First Response they can use that experience from the literature to solve this particular problem but don't ideally one should not replicate some other Sensations might have work in the context for that kind of data it's not necessary that you can work again uh now uh let me talk about family topics in plain solving the problems these are the uh topics that that were that are implemented that are in action as we solve the problem that's allow me to say the provision optimization uh statistics speech models then graph methods supervisors learning synthetic organization that was deep learning has been you know Lifeline for possible problems so these are the things that a data scientist would be conversantly when we decide and then comes the latest list of data sets now I am these are we have seen what a customer would like uh on the platform and what the organization wants in the platform ideally what exactly is expecting I hope data science can help here I am consciously avoiding talking about engineering growth product growth business so I'm only saying there are many ways of solving for example when you are talking about low paid personalization there are there is let us talk about search sets can happen in multiple ways by text image by voice that slowly is just my rough time and here are all living some three platforms that has started but it's going to penetrate much more and you would have seen the movement from text to image so it's just a matter of time it's going to be by voice then the search canopy one should ideally enable all these channels to search for an item and then again in terms of the model where it can be faced in such that you know that it's product which vertical you prepare you can go and search for that perforated with that it can be a big text representing about it then you need to figure out and try showing that and the general standard Rehabilitation is when ideally we should give the item that the customer is searching for example is the output this is the example we give uh whenever we talk about that such problem for example when you're trying to look at ion table are you looking for a table made of iron legs or a table for identity reports and similarly for example uh those kind of things like each Set uh what is that one has to show that he has got this thing what is a little bit later for uh replenishment models for example imagine you have you have a small bit of say old to one sold and a person bought 50 pack and can we recommend uh that 1050 pack say it will compare be 15 days anymore can we recommend every career that possibly your practice over is it time to buy baby in exercise are the same size we get back feedback so that kind of recommendations then a personal message so now I'm talking about frequently what it does let us say uh it's a like a vegetable and carbon food kind of like that and usually I buy certain credit Brands and when I search for that is it simply very light bread is it showing the bread usually because that kind of personalization is it happening so also it can be applicable to anything right because I need to restrict it to these kind of frequently contacts I'm doing it otherwise if supposing that something is foreign [Music] and similarly selection of items similar items important items such as they showed or not and at the time of that can we show supporting all this by brand name uh can I also be shown brand B of similar quality similar price limited color then only I would know otherwise I would always stick to the same brand and from the company point of the carbonation point of view I'll have to reach other brands which I bought because that's what the brand is getting sorted how do we actually use it to look at different products then at the time of purchase and end of the purchase for example your what items at a certain price possibly if you buy some more supposing the it costs everyone say three thousand nine hundred at four thousand you have an offer then can you suggest for example you have more shoes can I recommend some socks so that you will cross that number say ultimately two things so first of all I want to increase second thing is something is helpful to the customer you might have forgotten the natural thing and you buy issue and the socks you are not very restrictive you don't really think that okay where we can use five thousands of device or five stars you will have much more you really motivates so that kind of recognition Okay then in case of fashion can I virtually try out for example I am wearing uh I'm seeing a shirt with checkered shirt can I without and in such a way that it takes care of my body shape so you see I I don't want to look like a very like a six-pack person that's not again I'm not talking about I am whatever so I want to see an evolution on my body in my body can it be done that's a great customer experience then he can say yes which has to be it's a proper interaction for example I am going for a beauty product uh and uh I'm trying to ask that I am going to buy this foundation will it put on my skin color so one possibility is you can ask them to upload your picture then analyze your scheme and say that yes but your skin this is the right foundation please go ahead or that's not the one you must use this so these kind of interaction is really good response understanding that at the same time understanding the content from the beauty products so when they have various of information on each product can we summarize how do you generate the so-called question and answering kind of thing so those kind of thing how do you betray yourself understanding rather than the generation these are the important Concepts again productive uh again that's it clean up that's unnecessary sometimes what is there your catalog so as I said earlier you say it may be available in two different verticals can we collapsed can we properly it is and so that I can have a clean formation another thing is there can be each product will come with certain information description and keywords about it and uh and also image so those things are they available are they complete if they are Income incomplete how can we make them ideally when get product is getting onboarded these things are taken care again but they might have missed and you may have ended up with a lot of products it's in competitive works data sense can help solve your problems by looking at different products either by taking public domain information then again uh a little bit extraction from related text imagine a um a product is given it could be refrigerator can I create a description dimensions are a T-shirt and a generate description in the short sleeves around it uh with the graphic print that kind of people can generate that when I extract those information but also very creative speech about that onboarding and products similarities as well as the similar yeah Bitcoin foreign um if we were here then um the other thing is that content moderation in terms of text quality uh when a product is onboarded ideally some text is uploaded here is it complete and it is not complete so the data says models can help in fact there are a lot of data models can be built there to make their information company by learning from similar products in both in public domain in the private domain what is the data that is available and also some attributes the missing attributes can be completed so that the information is complete and they become searchable when you try searching for that particular code of those keywords will help setting for that product and the choice of text that is used to describe product image quality so it is possible that within fillers come can come from different places and supposing you are trying to sell a mobile cover the seller is from 18 to 1836 down and it is possible that when he tries to upload an email the quality is not good and uh and he may not have access to a high resolution uh Studio kind of a setup then in the given image can computer vision can help you to create to you may do email super resolution you can get into a better quality and similarly protect vertical revised by drip or can we clean it up and create a proper meaningful particles then text summarization in case of books supposing you are selling books can we summarize into a small text so that we will know better so these are other benefits models that could be used advertisements area how can we guarantee that certain religions are show and can we guarantee the people who want to advertise that it will be visible uh and how can we create those guarantees and ultimately it will turn into uh Revenue ending opportunity for the company uh things that are with text or bad images and you can prevent going onto the platform and at the same time the company will be mature enough to post even the critical comments that you know that is it goes a long way on the uh in building the trust or the platform and the other thing is about like reviews and details again moderation there is a fraud end into that yeah it is possible that when you have competing products you are selling certain products there are computers it is possible that some sellers May jack up their ratings participation in the race the ratings of their product and pull down the natives of the competitive product so data sales can help in identifying that kind of uh and optimal pricing models how do you price different items that are there on the platform so actually that you maximize Revenue at the same time and there can be so many other constraints which can be made when you're trying to do algorithms otherwise they should say a domain of certain group of people who have started of meeting the Rebellion they are they have their own ways of doing that in the price of the different items but algorithm pricing will go around me in terms of solving this problem it is systematic and mathematically sound great again optimal push notification we discussed previously earlier again with NLP based models and combined with optimization we can decide that ID and number of teams and we also analyze how we when we send a number of code how many people really adapted so should we moderate them in terms of the number of modifications that would go and the content will go and if there's a feedback channel that is open and a company is getting the feedback and analyze and bring the feedback into that modeling really yeah we talked about tripling instruments I won the example I gave is about baby diapers where they should really create it could be anything you know any consumable items maybe register so you know that that have to be bought in certain frequency uh how can we really do that kind of thing and also identified inform the organization that certain models are getting over you know you need to buy them and it takes you know you have the Deep Data before you once you're on them it will take its own time to come back to the uh you know then please considering those things you need to with models and what should contain what is the demand in that region for example uh imagine uh Diwali the body is popular across the country and any items that are specific to the company that popular Festival they should go uh irrespective of the place you should protect us all the warehouses Instagram example and Regional demand forecasting of each other each items every item that you have what is can we that means very long wait then performance restore almost you have to move and again the warehouse store optimization really new place items what are the items that are that frequently go what are the items where they should go imagine there are what we call them as speakers the people who try to pick the items and those speakers how quickly they have to go to those space and they can come back and bring that so naturally the frequency Bond items if they are put together in a common place they will fit those things and quickly come back and place them in a place then optimization of the pickup area member of pickles the staging area they will take you can put it in the staging area from there it will go to battery life so even any delay in any of these stages will deliver then again data science basically appear including in other models we can solve this problem optimal packaging in a company uh urlc for example you are ordering for sharing cartridges cartridges that are over if you want to buy two packages or buy cartridges income so how do you decide that if you leave it to the Packer who is doing the end job before it goes to you know transportation uh whatever backing that is available you will use you will also not like to use includes packet but quickly whatever is here we will take it maybe instead imagine a data science model works in the background first of all you you have to analyze how many packages what changes are there in the company how many optimal probability seats levels of packages is good enough so our 10 and can you recommend certain packet forever 30 or next level can you automatically you know push out that particular packet to the packet then he can take it there just like it and just go to the next steps and there are places in major companies where robots will do this kind of more window taken to the next level so even they if they spent matters ultimately radiograce how do you that kind of delay through the time cool then in terms of again outbound like as I said earlier in remote outbound itself we're having really anything like 30 to 30 models that work address models to foreign not every address has dual operation and uh ta2tfd all the money so can we then then you have to depend only your text to build models and again there are wherever these maps are available can we use map based geocode based models optimal shipment assignments to delivery agents again all not all deliverations are equally efficient and and then we need to allocate appropriately and maybe also use some incentive mechanism to make them look better and also identify right items to write people and there is also produced Army monitoring are there any couplings that's right shipment non-deliverables it is possible that some address when it is mentioned it's not it's interpret it's not deliverable when you realize that at the time of delivery it's too much for example the entire ordering system got activated it is big bag it has gone to delivery just before delivery you realize this is not available then you will go back to the customer your address is not available optimal start moving I wish to move what to store weight how many uh trucks you have to use what kind of different mechanisms you can transfer the some is it possible that in advance you store this thing and uh you know so that they can repeat faster and they can be delivered again when you when the truck really arrives it is arriving on Sunday where not many people are there if it's not even downloaded and it's not really uh you know put back in there so all these constraints all these models promise models yeah they take into all these constraints again the same thing is probably small promise time prediction so ultimately customer is happy if it is delivered faster supposing imagine you have a wiper and suddenly in English there is an important meeting tomorrow the worker router strength is not good you want exactly to buy one so you go to your popular site and want to buy and somebody who delivers two of us would love to have it and uh at the same time just to see the opposite and your sister's birthday you want to buy a gifted to your sister and you want it to be delivered on the birthday not a couple of days you want the separation that can you get any platform ensure that not many students with that kind of audience and but these kind of things these models taken care about the both the operational people's dictating and business requirements actually on ground what is happening uh all these things it can take it therefore to predict that with these conditions current conditions this is based on that we give the thermostat so this again there is a game though for example uh there are certain constraints in operation State they don't want to breach a promise time so if you don't want to breathe you have to do longer hours maybe what could be possibly delivered in India or two you would like to give two because you don't say one and if you breach the bad remark coming on the team you might give two that the moment c c two maybe customers are getting repulsed they don't want to buy that because two days is too much later so that has to be paid off so data sense will help to build that models are they doing it properly that kind of performance evaluation an NLP solution that speed up responses so if you analyze how many calls a calculator is getting what is the category what plot cluster of problems that typically they have to address and can you create a prairie responses to those queries and the movie called Center to get the concept by click of a button he gets that response this is what you have to respond then he responds customer is happy as I said earlier these are the days of the company to the customers if they respond well customers are happy with the company they will come back again when they don't respond well uh it's it's unfortunate they will be unhappy that when their problems similarly nowadays you would have seen that when we try to reach out to them when they are not available on this ratings to reduce thought as I said I gave an example of somebody artificially improving their own rating and putting out some of these database models can Graphics models have worked and there are a lot of Publications available in India again buyer when you want to reduce large response and certain products a company wants to make one have to have wants to have one lakh happy customer the intention is not to sell like happy questions how do you ensure that each person each mobile reaches only one of us then you have to add restrictions when you add restrictions we have spawn as a buyer supposing uh they call it a buyer has its own way of selling it again so those buyers you have to prevent them to order more number of items when you put constraints the player is and he would come out with another loophole and he tries to play with the system foreign but there are customers who would use it for a couple of days and they are not happy they will send it back but that is it's not sellable to anybody else so then the company has to kind of a notional uh compensation they might give you them but he's selling exploiting them in a bad way and easily saying even if it is similarly price and fraud imagine there is a there is a shoe that is costing it in four thousand rupees now I say that I'm sure the 8000 rupees on the platform and say that is 50 discount 60 discount and that is still higher than the what is printed and as a market is a bad customer expensive then how do people play with the pricing and those type of ones are there are many setups for example uh a reported item versus a Indian main idea they might show it as a imported item and they jog the price you know I try to save for example so that is important as well as delivery from so you would have had to use the brand news articles uh news items like I ordered for certain thing instead I got something else in my package and the pack the packet would say damn point and the organizations continuously innovate to minimize this kind of things they have a lot of mechanisms you would have seen 40ps nowadays they asked delivery packaging uh so many things monitoring the deliveries all these things so here again uh data science helps to build models and analyze similarly there are many models that right tries to understand customer Behavior among these graphs they are address clustering similar similar addresses that are clustered then it can also be to prevent a broad angle but also to know addresses of similar Pages how many are there in a given region it will help to supply chain to do better jio clusters of customers in regionalized clusters mining of hidden planets one is what a whatever is there feasible to you that the hidden in that massive data set there are hidden patterns there are many conversions can be run into identify those hidden patterns what's your abundance creating when people buying also buying these items can be declared that once you do that you can recommend make recommendations and there are multiple applications the ones that are available you can have health review and being a package grouping the items for sales in sales events you can continue them together we know that they sell today so I can promote a new item that was not usually not getting sold by bundling them in other areas so likewise there are multiple applications where is the customer lifetime value each customer if I know uh this one accordingly I can make a lot of business decisions but tailored the tailored and these are all the models that work in the background just in a passive manner duplicate the customers what more incentive to get the customer so that these things those signals will become part of the other models that work particularly company they are all each there are many more models in fact even the companies that I work there pretty much was I did not wherever these models are in public domain and there are Publications I mentioned them and wherever not they have not become in public I avoided talking about them but each company will have its own requirements their business directions will be different what they want to maximize may be different accordingly data science has to understand those data science teams have to understand those requirements accordingly caterpillars requirements and meet understand the organization expectations customer expectations bring both of them and solutions that are the customer facing as well as work in the background they're all required to work in Canada uh continuously now I have given uh ecosystem guys I talked about big business problems vs life cycle we discussed and most often we get engaged with business programs then we need to figure out a formal statement and solve the problems and it's very important to collaborate with stakeholders we cannot work in isolation and I have not discussed the entire the massive area of deployments the latest things and how do you deploy how do you monitor uh how do you create pipelines of Twitter bytes of data traffic to Modern building and if it is in real time there are many more challenges offline also you have a lot of challenges so those aspects but there are many nuances towards them again monitoring of treat and retaining Cycles again like a model then you will have to replay the algorithms and replay the same things depending on the model it'll be different sometimes it will be online sometimes monthly replaying sometimes the six months it all depends on the problem the kind of data change and operational issues have to be taken into Department in solving Networks and similarly monitoring data science performance when they're making the problems how do you really alert the data scientists to look at the problems so these are some of the Publications and all these Publications give a a footage to the area and uh there are different areas different topics and modern has discovered the topics that I do last level Publications I contributed my iot as my first other Publications are I worked along with the teams so these are broadly these are the aliens thank you I'm open to questions if you haven't uh is foreign when we do that we may need to artificially generate some examples so that is where you require to generate larger data sets so that the model can be built and assessed that's where anything which includes this is a practitioners so because you work in that area you know that this is the entire new 360 degree view of the problems I don't think there is one like for each of them as they show no in terms of references those areas you pick up but a bird's eye view of how a customer would work uh how a e-commerce company work and other kind of problems um see each problem each company requires a different type of things so that way uh I mean there is uh there's no need to keep as a entire I mean you need to bring out a book which will cover everything together maybe somebody would take the initiative and think that uh yeah I don't think there is anything definitely there's a need for that it's good to send stage everybody that is the idea of this topic although I have carefully avoided all images pictures it earned much better then I have to use somebody's picture so then again I don't know that I have permission server so that's where I have other pictures it's required I agree with you the required that somebody has to give that comprehensively a practitioner only will give you that kind of things for example somebody is working in action assistant seeing us deeply into that area and he has multiple Publications in that area uh similarly somebody is working in demand prediction they want to understand but tagging all that entire customer Journey at every index Point what models are there I don't think there will be any foreign so data science can solve the problems but engineering side there are ways of preventing that there can be uh checks and balances while doing that for example there is a Brute Force attack that we can OTP or something you can always prevent uh you can quickly identify those uh IP addresses where these are emanating you can stop them in many cases they are good enough otherwise in a conventional data science site we can look at a different how much of data packets that are coming in how much are going out what kind of attack is there how much time that that how many times what is the frequency of attack so likewise you know you can think of at least 50 60 signals and you can put a ml model there are solutions uh to do that you can build an ml model as soon as that is there and they were very very fast you can build that but again like I said earlier like a fraud thing you know like they keep evolving but not within the e-commerce companies which is possible but there are primitive mechanisms in a conventional operation cellular unit which will work I think that yes foreign data at least I have so far I haven't seen any applications there foreign [Music] um the question is about uh uh why you should really follow customer service approach why can't we use a solution that already worked elsewhere why can't we replicator is a question so typically uh when we work on Genesis model but they would have used a particular database I'm not saying that it would never work but uh blind replication is radius so it would have worked for that particular data set which will be distinct from the currently whatever you are using the signals will be different the way the importance of one partner feature may be different from what is happening elsewhere so that's where blind replication is radius but you can still take the approach they have missed approach can be repeated but not the you know blind replication that is statistics those workflow you can still use so maybe they haven't used the CNN then after that they would have done something those kind of things you can always follow but not exactly a blind replication of that that code there is a question on chat uh so the question is how important is domain knowledge for a data scientist or can one learn on the job if it is a free requisite how can one develop it so domain knowledge is important when we try solving the problem you need to understand I'll tell you uh one example supposing promise type prediction and the promise time prediction you really when you talk to the organization scheme they understand you understand the problems that the stock doesn't come on time lorries don't come all the time and uh and when the two three drugs come from say Chennai to Delhi imagine and they bring a lot of material to Delhi it's almost and all of them land in the same way it is impossible to pick the items and try delivering it the same day first of all you bring them try to understand and scan all the items that are come from there then try to segregate them it will take two three days so that also will delay things these things also have to be integrated into model possibly you can also recommend that what can be done so domain knowledge can be understood okay that by keeping your eyes yes and Eyes Open by talking to the interaction that stakeholder team you will understand and these kind of nuances and you know you cannot uh you cannot get attach the way knowledge uh much before getting into them but when you get into the water you lose it so what you can learn in a university training is the approaches uh methods uh metrics for example you can build a model how do you say that the model is working well what is the activities and what accuracy Matrix you have to use is there imbalance in the data if that balances there is some example fraud there are strong far many good cases than bad cases so in that case what should be the ideal limits so this is what you complained to the work as a pressure from the University as an experienced person you would have solved certain problems in certain domains now with that experience you start solving some new problems so very rarely you will have entire exported to the problem before you come and start working in this unseening in a new company if there are no questions you can probably wrap it up this opportunity so that my intention is to give an overview of what happens in e-commerce okay completely 60 degree view of how the problems come how do you solve how different points of view have been put together how data science can proactively getting and try solving those problems and why collaboration is important why do you why you need to understand domain well as you solve problems why we should not replicate and save problems why you should stay intact with your first principles approach you understand the domain you try to figure out how to solve problem so this is that again one of the idea is to view entire picture uh for the even experienced people and the pressures he wants to understand what is happening thank you for the opportunity thank you for coming all of you to come to the for coming to the office and attending thanks
