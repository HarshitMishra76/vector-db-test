    "**Key Differences in Data Models**\n\nMongoDB uses a **document-based data model**, which is based on a collection of JSON-style documents. In this model, each document can have a different structure, allowing for flexible and dynamic data modeling.\n\nOn the other hand, PostgreSQL uses a **relational data model**, based on a collection of tables with defined schemas. Data in the tables is organized in a way that eliminates redundant information and ensures data integrity through constraints and referential integrity.\n\nThese differences in data models enable MongoDB to be a good choice for companies requiring adaptable and dynamic data structures, such as web and mobile apps, real-time analytics, and content management systems. Meanwhile, PostgreSQL is better suited for companies that require strict data consistency and complex data manipulations, such as financial systems, data warehousing, and business intelligence software.",

ConclusionIn this blog post, we first provided a brief overview of two popular databases:MongoDB and PostgreSQL, then contrasted their benefits and drawbacks, and lastdemonstrated various use cases for each. I hope this has given you a better grasp ofthem. MongoDB is a NoSQL database with a flexible database that is ideal forapplications that need to constantly update unstructured data. The relationaldatabase PostgreSQL, on the other hand, supports complex query operations andcan ensure data integrity when using structured data models. These two databaseshave their own strengths and weaknesses, and users need to choose according tothe needs of the program.If you want to know more about these two databases, you can refer to the followingmaterials:https://www.mongodb.com/compare/mongodb-postgresqlhttps://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained/nosql-vs-sqlVII.

Therefore, it isrecommended for users to learn SQL to get the most understanding of the usageof PostgreSQL.2.2 PostgreSQL CRUD Operation2.2.1 SQL version CRUDSQL (Structured Query Language) Example for CRUD operations in PostgreSQL:1. Create Table:A table can be created through PostgreSQL using the <CREATE TABLE> command.This CREATE operation is to create a Table named \u201cusers\u201d in a database. This tablehas 4 attributes, including id (as the primary key), name, email, and age.CREATE TABLE users (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,name TEXT NOT NULL,email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,29/07/2024, 12:41Dive into MongoDB & PostgreSQL | SFU Professional Computer Science\nhttps://medium.com/sfu-cspmp/dive-into-mongodb-postgresql-d8bbbda3cb24#:~:text=3.-,Performance,unstructured and semi-structured data.9/25",
      "In PostgreSQL, you can create a record by using the \u2018INSERT\u2019 statement to insert aJSON object into a table column that has been defined as the \u2018json\u2019 or \u2018jsonb\u2019 datatype. For example:CREATE TABLE customers ( id serial PRIMARY KEY, customer_info jsonb );INSERT INTO customers (customer_info)VALUES ('{\"name\": \"John Doe\", \"email\": \"jdoe@example.com\", \"age\": 30}');2. Querying RecordsTo query records in PostgreSQL, you can use the \u2018SELECT\u2019 statement along with the\u2018->>\u2019 operator to extract specific values from the JSON object stored in the table. Forexample:SELECT customer_info->>'name' AS name, customer_info->>'email' AS email, custom3. Updating RecordsTo update a record in PostgreSQL, you can use the \u2018UPDATE\u2019 statement along withthe \u2018->>\u2019 operator to modify specific values within the JSON object stored in thetable. For example:UPDATE customersSET customer_info = customer_info || '{\"age\": 31}'WHERE customer_info->>'name' = 'John Doe';4. Deleting RecordsTo delete a record in PostgreSQL, you can use the \u2018DELETE\u2019 statement along with a\u2018WHERE\u2019 clause to specify the document you want to delete.

PostgreSQL\n1. Overview of PostgreSQLPostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS)that is well-known for its advanced SQL features, scalability, high availability, andstrong security and data integrity. It is a community-driven development projectthat emphasizes scalability and standard compliance. PostgreSQL provides a rangeof advanced SQL functions, including support for complex data types andtransactions. The system is highly scalable and features built-in replication andconnection pooling for high availability. It is capable of processing complex queriesefficiently even at large scales and has robust security features like fine-grainedaccess control and encryption. The user community of PostgreSQL is extensive andwell-developed, providing ample resources for users.\n29/07/2024, 12:41Dive into MongoDB & PostgreSQL | SFU Professional Computer Science\nhttps://medium.com/sfu-cspmp/dive-into-mongodb-postgresql-d8bbbda3cb24#:~:text=3.-,Performance,unstructured and semi-structured data.8/25"

Data ModelMongoDB uses a document-based data model, while PostgreSQL uses a relationaldata model.MongoDB uses a document-oriented data model, which is based on a collection ofJSON-style documents. In this model, each document can have a different structure,allowing for flexible and dynamic data modeling. Because of this, MongoDB is agood choice for companies requiring adaptable and dynamic data structures, likeweb and mobile apps, real-time analytics, and content management systems. Thisdocument-based model allows for easy aggregation and scalability that can handlecomplex queries using document nested structures and indexes.On the other hand, PostgreSQL uses a relational data model, based on a collection oftables with defined schemas. In this model, data is organized into tables, whereeach row represents an individual record, and each column corresponds to aspecific field of the record. Data in the tables is organized in a way that eliminates29/07/2024, 12:41Dive into MongoDB & PostgreSQL | SFU Professional Computer Science\nhttps://medium.com/sfu-cspmp/dive-into-mongodb-postgresql-d8bbbda3cb24#:~:text=3.-,Performance,unstructured and semi-structured data.12/25",

Below is an example of a document, the \u201c_id\u201d field is anautomatically generated primary key for this document.{   \"_id\": ObjectId(\"5f1437b936c67f5c04adf38a\"),   \"name\": \"David Wilson\",   \"age\": 25,   \"address\": {   \"street\": \"987 Broadway\",   \"city\": \"New York\",   \"state\": \"NY\",   \"zipcode\": 10010   },   \"employee_since\": ISODate(\"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z\")}2.2 CollectionA collection in MongoDB consists of a group of related documents, it is equivalent toa table in a relational database. Yet the collection by default will not strictly enforcea fixed schema (the key difference between a collection and a table), which meansthe documents in one collection can have different fields.3. Get started with MongoDB3.1 Connect to MongoDB3.1.1 MongoDB deploymentBefore connecting to MongoDB, a MongoDB instance needs to be created first, it canbe either an instance deployed using MongoDB Atlas or a standalone instancehosted on a user\u2019s own machine.MongoDB Atlas is a fully managed service in the cloud, allowing for easy setupwithout the need to manage the underlying infrastructure. Standalone MongoDBinstances require software downloads and management infrastructure whileproviding the user with greater control and customization.3.1.2 Using MongoDB Shell29/07/2024, 12:41Dive into MongoDB & PostgreSQL | SFU Professional Computer Science\nhttps://medium.com/sfu-cspmp/dive-into-mongodb-postgresql-d8bbbda3cb24#:~:text=3.-,Performance,unstructured and semi-structured data.4/25",

This characteristic makes PostgreSQL a powerful tool forcompanies that require strict data consistency and complex data manipulations,such as financial systems, data warehousing, and business intelligence software.In general, the choice between MongoDB and PostgreSQL will depend on thespecific requirements, including the size and complexity of the data being stored,the specific workload demands, and the balance between flexible data modellingand strict data consistency.2. Query languageMongoDB and PostgreSQL have different query languages because of the differentdata models used that they choose.MongoDB uses a query language based on the MongoDB query syntax, which isdesigned to support querying and manipulating the semi-structured data stored inMongoDB documents. MQL is used to search and retrieve data from MongoDBcollections. The syntax is straightforward and easy to understand, even for non-technical users. This makes MongoDB a good choice for developers who need toquickly prototype and build applications.Meanwhile, PostgreSQL uses a query language based on the Structured QueryLanguage (SQL), which is a widely used and well-established standard for relationaldatabases. The SQL query language supports a wide range of query types, includingsimple select statements, as well as more complex join operations, subqueries, andtransactions. SQL also supports the use of subqueries, transactions, and storedprocedures for more complex data manipulations. Queries in PostgreSQL can beexecuted using the SELECT statement, and results can be returned in a variety offormats, including tables, arrays, and key-value pairs.3. PerformanceMongoDB is faster for read-heavy or write-heavy workloads, while PostgreSQL isbetter suited for complex transactions and data analysis.MongoDB is designed for high performance and scalability and is well-suited forhandling large amounts of unstructured and",
