  "answer": [
    "**I don't have an answer**\n\nThe provided context is a research paper about using Machine Learning algorithms for detecting botnets and malicious traffic in a network, but it does not explicitly discuss prevention methods. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context. If you'd like, I can help you explore possible ways to prevent cyber attacks, though!",
    "**Ahah!**\n\nAccording to the provided context, **AI- and deep learning (DL)-based systems are being used in agriculture for weed detection**, emphasizing recent trends in DL. Various DL methods are discussed to clarify their overall potential, usefulness, and performance.\n\nAdditionally, the text highlights that AI-based systems have proven to be more accurate than traditional techniques in detecting and classifying weeds and crops, and can automatically extract information from large amounts of data used to model complex problems.\n\nHope this helps!",
    "**Machine Learning is used to classify malicious traffic in a network by analyzing features extracted from NetFlow datasets through a feature selection process, and then applying five different machine learning algorithms. The Random Forest Classifier succeeds in detecting more than 95% of botnets in 8 out of 13 scenarios and more than 55% in the most difficult datasets.**",
    "**How Geopolitical Risk Analysis Affects Market Volatility**\n\nAccording to the provided context, this study addresses the influence of geopolitical risks on financial markets, particularly in recent events like the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war. The authors employ Bi-Directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks with attention mechanisms to analyze data and capture nuanced effects of geopolitical events on market volatility.\n\nThe objective is to develop a predictive model that analyzes the impact of geopolitical risks on market volatility, both during and post-crisis periods. By examining historical financial data and the Geopolitical Risk Index (GPRI), this study aims to provide valuable insights into the dynamics of financial markets in the face of geopolitical challenges.\n\nIn summary, geopolitic risk analysis significantly affects market volatility by capturing nuanced effects of geopolitical events on market movements. This study's predictive model can guide informed financial decisions during times of unrest and enable long-term understanding of market behavior under such conditions.",
    "**How sensors along with Machine Learning (ML) are used to improve agriculture?**\n\nThe text doesn't explicitly mention the use of sensors and ML for improving agriculture. However, it does discuss the application of Machine Vision in agriculture, including weed detection and control.\n\nMachine Vision uses cameras and computer algorithms to analyze images and detect objects such as weeds. The algorithm can then be trained using Machine Learning (ML) techniques to improve its accuracy in detecting and classifying weeds.\n\nIn this context, sensors are likely used to collect data from the field, which is then fed into ML algorithms for analysis and decision-making. For example, sensors could measure environmental factors like temperature, humidity, and light intensity, as well as detect the presence of weeds or pests.\n\nWhile the text doesn't explicitly state how sensors and ML are used together in agriculture, it suggests that these technologies can be combined to improve crop yield and food production while minimizing environmental impact.",
    "Based on the provided research articles, it can be inferred that market behavior during a pandemic is largely influenced by volatility spillovers between stock markets and cryptocurrencies. The study highlights the importance of understanding how financial markets respond to both current and potential future developments during periods of social unrest.\n\nIn particular, the article [1] suggests that there is a direct correlation between price movements and ongoing events, as well as public speculation. This dual nature of market responses - reactive to present situations and potential developments - is essential for accurately predicting market trends in volatile periods.\n\nThe study also emphasizes the need to develop predictive models that analyze the impact of geopolitical risks on market volatility, particularly during and after significant global events like pandemics. By examining historical financial data and the Geopolitical Risk Index (GPRI), the model can forecast market behavior in response to both current and incoming future developments during such events.\n\nIn terms of specific insights into market behavior during a pandemic, it is difficult to provide a direct answer without further analysis or information on the specific pandemic in question. However, based on general trends and patterns observed in financial markets during times of crisis, it can be hypothesized that:\n\n1. Market volatility may increase as investors react to uncertainty and potential economic disruption caused by the pandemic.\n2. Liquidity may decrease as market participants become more risk-averse and hesitant to engage in trading activities.\n3. Certain asset classes or sectors may be impacted more severely than others due to their exposure to industries directly affected by the pandemic (e.g., travel, tourism, healthcare).\n4. Central banks and governments may intervene to stabilize financial markets through monetary policy adjustments, fiscal stimulus packages, or other measures.\n\nTo better understand market behavior during a pandemic, I would recommend examining empirical evidence from previous pandemics, such as COVID-19, as well as studying the impact of geopolitical risks on financial markets in general.",

    "Anomaly detection is a crucial technique used in cybersecurity to identify potential attacks or malicious activities on a network. In the context of CAMNEP, MINDS, and Xu algorithms, anomaly detection involves analyzing network traffic (NetFlows) to identify patterns that deviate from expected behavior.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **Model creation**: The system creates a model of expected network traffic based on normal patterns.\n2. **Real-time analysis**: As new NetFlows are received, they are compared to the expected model.\n3. **Discrepancies detected**: If a NetFlow deviates significantly from the expected pattern, it is flagged as an anomaly or potential attack.\n\nIn CAMNEP, this process occurs across three layers:\n\n1. **Anomaly detectors**: Each detector uses a different set of features to analyze NetFlows and identify anomalies.\n2. **Trust models**: The outputs from each detector are aggregated into events, which are then evaluated by the trust model.\n3. **Aggregator layer**: The aggregator layer integrates the individual opinions of multiple anomaly detectors to create a composite output.\n\nSimilarly, MINDS uses data mining techniques to detect attacks by building context information for each NetFlow based on features such as source IP address, destination host, and port numbers. Anomalies are detected by calculating the distance between a given NetFlow and normal samples.\n\nXu's algorithm also involves creating context information for each NetFlow and detecting anomalies using classification rules that divide traffic into normal and anomalous flows.\n\nIn summary, anomaly detection in cybersecurity is about identifying patterns that deviate from expected behavior in network traffic. By comparing real-time data to a model of expected traffic, systems like CAMNEP, MINDS, and Xu can detect potential attacks or malicious activities on a network.",

The algorithm learns to recognize patterns in the normal traffic and anomalies that deviate from this normal behavior. This approach has been shown to be effective for detecting unknown or zero-day attacks, which are not present in the training data.\n\nIn addition, supervised learning can also be used for Regression tasks, such as predicting the likelihood of a network connection being malicious based on various factors (e.g., IP addresses, packet rates).

This\nstudy showcases a model combining financial indices with the\nGeopolitical Risk Index (GPRI), employing Bi-LSTM networks\nwith attention mechanisms to analyze the data. This approach\ncaptures the nuanced effects of geopolitical events on market\nvolatility.

I NTRODUCTION\nIn an increasingly interconnected global economy, finan-\ncial markets are susceptible to a range of influences, with\ngeopolitical risks being a particularly impactful factor. The\nrecent COVID-19 pandemic, Russia-Ukraine war and riots\nin France (Nahel Merzouk riots) [3] has underscored this\ninterdependence, leading to heightened volatility.\nEvents of social unrest play a vital role in forecasting\nthe dynamics of financial markets during times of geopo-\nlitical unrest. This is primarily because market movements\nare reactionary and anticipatory. In periods of geopolitical\ntension, markets often respond to both the immediate impact\nof social disturbances and the expectations of what might\nunfold next.

      "of social disturbances and the expectations of what might\nunfold next. It can be said that a direct correlation exists\nbetween price movements and ongoing events as well as\nthe public\u2019s speculation. Understanding this dual nature of\nmarket responses\u2014reactive to present situations and potential\ndevelopments\u2014is essential for accurately predicting market\ntrends in such volatile periods. [1]\nThe objective is to develop a predictive model that analyses\nthe impact of geopolitical risks on market volatility i.e., during\nand post COVID era, during and post Russia-Ukraine war era\netc. By examining historical financial data and the Geopolitical\nRisk Index (GPRI) [2], the model forecasts market behavior in\nresponse to events of major social unrest helping to decipherhow financial markets might behave in response to both current\nand the incoming future during geopolitical events.\nThis study introduces novel contributions in predicting\nfinancial market behavior both during and after significant\nglobal events of tension. The novelty of this research lies in\nits ability to forecast market trends in these critical periods.\nThe methodology involves compiling an extensive dataset that\nincludes essential financial indices and the Geopolitical Risk\nIndex (GPRI), serving as a gauge for geopolitical instability.\nTo analyze this data, the study employs sophisticated ma-\nchine learning models, namely:\n\u2022Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) net-\nworks.\n\u2022Bi-LSTM networks with an added attention layer.\n\u2022Dual Bi-LSTM layers coupled with an attention layer.\nThese models are adept at capturing both the chronological\nsequences and the subtle influences of major events on market\nvolatility. This approach allows for a nuanced understanding\nof how markets respond to geopolitical crises, including both\nimmediate reactions and subsequent developments.

      "of social disturbances and the expectations of what might\nunfold next. It can be said that a direct correlation exists\nbetween price movements and ongoing events as well as\nthe public\u2019s speculation. Understanding this dual nature of\nmarket responses\u2014reactive to present situations and potential\ndevelopments\u2014is essential for accurately predicting market\ntrends in such volatile periods. [1]\nThe objective is to develop a predictive model that analyses\nthe impact of geopolitical risks on market volatility i.e., during\nand post COVID era, during and post Russia-Ukraine war era\netc. By examining historical financial data and the Geopolitical\nRisk Index (GPRI) [2], the model forecasts market behavior in\nresponse to events of major social unrest helping to decipherhow financial markets might behave in response to both current\nand the incoming future during geopolitical events.\nThis study introduces novel contributions in predicting\nfinancial market behavior both during and after significant\nglobal events of tension. The novelty of this research lies in\nits ability to forecast market trends in these critical periods.\nThe methodology involves compiling an extensive dataset that\nincludes essential financial indices and the Geopolitical Risk\nIndex (GPRI), serving as a gauge for geopolitical instability.\nTo analyze this data, the study employs sophisticated ma-\nchine learning models, namely:\n\u2022Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) net-\nworks.\n\u2022Bi-LSTM networks with an added attention layer.\n\u2022Dual Bi-LSTM layers coupled with an attention layer.\nThese models are adept at capturing both the chronological\nsequences and the subtle influences of major events on market\nvolatility. This approach allows for a nuanced understanding\nof how markets respond to geopolitical crises, including both\nimmediate reactions and subsequent developments. By focus-\ning on the predictive capabilities during and after periods of\nunrest, this study offers valuable insights into the dynamics"

      "and interview study. These open challenges have been organized into the categories of organizational, ML system, and operational challenges. Organizational challenges. The mindset and culture of data science practice is a typical challenge in organizational settings [2]. As our insights from literature and interviews show, to successfully develop and run ML products, there needs to be a culture shift away from model-driven machine learning toward a product-oriented discipline [\u03b3]. The recent trend of data-centric AI also addresses this aspect by putting more focus on the data-related aspects taking place prior to the ML model building. Especially the roles associated with these activities should have a product-focused perspective when designing ML products [\u03b3]. A great number of skills and individual roles are required for MLOps (\u03b2). As our identified sources point out, there is a lack of highly skilled experts for these roles\u2014especially with regard to architects, data engineers, ML engineers, and DevOps engineers [29,41,44] [\u03b1, \u03b5]. This is related to the necessary education of future professionals\u2014as MLOps is typically not part of data science education [7] [\u03b3]. Posoldova (2020) [35] further stresses this aspect by remarking that students should not only learn about model creation, but must also learn about technologies and components necessary to build functional ML products.  Data scientists alone cannot achieve the goals of MLOps. A multi-disciplinary team is required [14], thus MLOps needs to be a group process [\u03b1]. This is often hindered because teams work in silos rather than in cooperative setups [\u03b1]. Additionally, different knowledge levels and specialized terminologies make communication difficult. To lay the foundations for more fruitful setups, the respective decision-makers need to be convinced that an increased MLOps maturity and a product-focused mindset will yield clear business improvements [\u03b3].

Most of all, it is an engineering practice that leverages three contributing disciplines: machine learning, software engineering (especially DevOps), and data engineering. MLOps is aimed at productionizing machine learning systems by bridging the gap between development (Dev) and operations (Ops).

Retraining is not only triggered automatically when a statistical threshold is reached; it can also be triggered when new feature data is available, or it can be scheduled periodically. 6 Conceptualization With the findings at hand, we conceptualize the literature and interviews. It becomes obvious that the term MLOps is positioned at the intersection of machine learning, software engineering, DevOps, and data engineering (see Figure 5 in the Appendix). We define MLOps as follows: MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is a paradigm, including aspects like best practices, sets of concepts, as well as a development culture when it comes to the end-to-end conceptualization, implementation, monitoring, deployment, and scalability of machine learning products. Most of all, it is an engineering practice that leverages three contributing disciplines: machine learning, software engineering (especially DevOps), and data engineering. MLOps is aimed at productionizing machine learning systems by bridging the gap between development (Dev) and operations (Ops). Essentially, MLOps aims to facilitate the creation of machine learning products by leveraging these principles: CI/CD automation, workflow orchestration, reproducibility; versioning of data, model, and code; collaboration; continuous ML training and evaluation; ML metadata tracking and logging; continuous monitoring; and feedback loops. 7 Open Challenges Several challenges for adopting MLOps have been identified after conducting the literature review, tool review, and interview study. These open challenges have been organized into the categories of organizational, ML system, and operational challenges. Organizational challenges. The mindset and culture of data"

      "6 MLOps Task 4: Ef\ufb01cient Continuous Quality Testing\nOne of the key motivations for DevOps principles in the \ufb01rst place is the ability to perform fast cycles and\ncontinuously ensure the robustness of a system by quickly adapting to changes. At the same time, both are well-\nknown requirements from traditional software development that naturally extend to the MLOps world. One\nchallenge faced by many MLOps practitioners is the necessity to deal with the shift of data distributions when\nmodels are in production. When new production data comes from a different (unknown) distribution, models\ntrained over previously seen data distributions might not perform well anymore.\nMLOps Challenge While there has been various research on automatic domain adaption [45, 50, 54], we\nidentify a different challenge when presented with a collection of models, each of which could be a \u201cstaled\nmodel\u201d or an automatically adapted model given some domain adaption method. This scenario is quite common\nin many companies \u2014 they often train distinct models on different slices of data independently (for instance\none model for each season) and automatically adapt each of these models using different methods for new data.\nAs a result, they often have access to a large set of models that could be deployed, hoping to know which one\nto use given a fresh collection of production data (e.g., the current time period such as the current day). The\nchallenge is, given an unlabeled production data stream, to pick the model that performs best. From the MLOps\nperspective, the goal is to minimize the amount of labels needed to acquire in order to make such a distinction.\nA Data Quality View Concept shift is by its de\ufb01nition related to the timeliness properties of the data. The\navailable pre-trained models are intended to capture the changes of training data over time. Naturally, simple\nrules can be applied to choose the current model if one has access to some meta information about both the cur-",

A major challenge with regard to MLOps systems is designing for fluctuating demand, especially in relation to the process of ML training [7]. This stems from potentially voluminous and varying data [10], which makes it difficult to precisely estimate the necessary infrastructure resources (CPU, RAM, and GPU) and requires a high level of flexibility in terms of scalability of the infrastructure [7,26] [\u03b4]. Operational challenges. In productive settings, it is challenging to operate ML manually due to different stacks of software and hardware components and their interplay. Therefore, robust automation is required [7,17]. Also, a constant incoming stream of new data forces retraining capabilities. This is a repetitive task which, again, requires a high level of automation [18] [\u03b8]. These repetitive tasks yield a large number of artifacts that require a strong governance [24,29,40] as well as versioning of data, model, and code to ensure robustness and reproducibility [11,27,29]. Lastly, it is challenging to resolve a potential support request (e.g., by finding the root cause), as many parties and components are involved. Failures can be a combination of ML infrastructure and software [26]. 8 Conclusion With the increase of data availability and analytical capabilities, coupled with the constant pressure to innovate, more machine learning products than ever are being developed.

      "Machine Learning Operations (MLOps):  Overview, Definition, and Architecture Dominik Kreuzberger  KIT  Germany dominik.kreuzberger@alumni.kit.edu Niklas K\u00fchl  KIT  Germany  kuehl@kit.edu  Sebastian Hirschl   IBM\u2020   Germany   sebastian.hirschl@de.ibm.comABSTRACT The final goal of all industrial machine learning (ML) projects is to develop ML products and rapidly bring them into production. However, it is highly challenging to automate and operationalize ML products and thus many ML endeavors fail to deliver on their expectations. The paradigm of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) addresses this issue. MLOps includes several aspects, such as best practices, sets of concepts, and development culture. However, MLOps is still a vague term and its consequences for researchers and professionals are ambiguous. To address this gap, we conduct mixed-method research, including a literature review, a tool review, and expert interviews. As a result of these investigations, we provide an aggregated overview of the necessary principles, components, and roles, as well as the associated architecture and workflows. Furthermore, we furnish a definition of MLOps and highlight open challenges in the field. Finally, this work provides guidance for ML researchers and practitioners who want to automate and operate their ML products with a designated set of technologies.

Moreover, combining both approaches and supporting a\nlabor-ef\ufb01cient cleaning approach for general ML models remains an open research problem.\n4 MLOps Task 2: Preventing Unrealistic Expectations\nIn DevOps practices, new projects are typically initiated with a feasibility study , in order to evaluate and under-\nstand the probability of success. The goal of such a study is to prevent users with unrealistic expectations from\nspending a lot of of money and time on developing solutions that are doomed to fail. However, when it comes to\nMLOps practices, such a feasibility study step is largely missing \u2014 we often see users with high expectations,\nbut with a very noisy dataset, starting an expensive training process which is almost surely doomed to fail.\nMLOps Challenge One principled way to model the feasibility study problem for ML is to ask: Given an\nML task, de\ufb01ned by its training and validation sets, how to estimate the error that the best possible ML model\ncan achieve, without running expensive ML training? The answer to this question is linked to a traditional\nML problem, i.e., to estimate the Bayes error rate (also called irreducible error ). It is a quantity related to\nthe underlying data distribution and estimating it using \ufb01nite amount of data is known to be a notoriously hard\nproblem. Despite decades of study [10, 16, 42], providing a practical BER estimator is still an open research\nproblem and there are no known practical systems that can work on real-world large-scale datasets. One key\nchallenge to make feasibility study a practical MLOps step is to understand how to utilize decades of theoretical\nstudies on the BER estimation and which compromises and optimizations to perform.\nNon-Zero Bayes Error and Data Quality Issues At the \ufb01rst glance, even understanding why the BER is",

      "model is often to improve the dataset, via means such as data cleaning, integration, and label acquisition. As\nMLOps aims to understand ,measure , and improve the quality of ML models, it is not surprising to see that data\nquality is playing a prominent and central role in MLOps. In fact, many researchers have conducted fascinating\nand seminal work around MLOps by looking into different aspects of data quality. Substantial effort has been\nmade in the areas of data acquisition with weak supervision (e.g., Snorkel [29]), ML engineering pipelines (e.g.,\nTFX [25]), data cleaning (e.g., ActiveClean [27]), data quality veri\ufb01cation (e.g., Deequ [40, 41]), interaction\n(e.g., Northstar [26]), or \ufb01ne-grained monitoring and improvement (e.g., Overton [30]), to name a few.\nMeanwhile, for decades data quality has been an active and exciting research area led by the data manage-\nment community [7, 37, 47], having in mind that the majority of the studies are agnostic to the downstream ML\nmodels (with prominent recent exceptions such as ActiveClean [27]). Independent of downstream ML models,\nresearchers have studied different aspects of data quality that can naturally be split across the following four\ndimensions [7]: (1) accuracy \u2013 the extent to which the data are correct, reliable and certi\ufb01ed for the task at hand;\n(2)completeness \u2013 the degree to which the given data collection includes data that describe the corresponding\nset of real-world objects; (3) consistency \u2013 the extent of violation of semantic rules de\ufb01ned over a set of data;\nand (4) timeliness (also referred to as currency orvolatility ) \u2013 the extent to which data are up-to-date for a task.\n1arXiv:2102.07750v1  [cs.LG]  15 Feb 2021"

      "Machine Learning Operations (MLOps):  Overview, Definition, and Architecture Dominik Kreuzberger  KIT  Germany dominik.kreuzberger@alumni.kit.edu Niklas K\u00fchl  KIT  Germany  kuehl@kit.edu  Sebastian Hirschl   IBM\u2020   Germany   sebastian.hirschl@de.ibm.comABSTRACT The final goal of all industrial machine learning (ML) projects is to develop ML products and rapidly bring them into production. However, it is highly challenging to automate and operationalize ML products and thus many ML endeavors fail to deliver on their expectations. The paradigm of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) addresses this issue. MLOps includes several aspects, such as best practices, sets of concepts, and development culture. However, MLOps is still a vague term and its consequences for researchers and professionals are ambiguous. To address this gap, we conduct mixed-method research, including a literature review, a tool review, and expert interviews. As a result of these investigations, we provide an aggregated overview of the necessary principles, components, and roles, as well as the associated architecture and workflows. Furthermore, we furnish a definition of MLOps and highlight open challenges in the field. Finally, this work provides guidance for ML researchers and practitioners who want to automate and operate their ML products with a designated set of technologies.

The CAMNEP system uses a set of anomaly detection model that maintain a\nmodel of expected tra\ufb03c on the network and compare it with real tra\ufb03c to identify the discrepancies that\nare identi\ufb01ed as possible attacks. It has three principal layers that evaluate the tra\ufb03c: anomaly detectors,\ntrust models, and anomaly aggregators. The anomaly detector layer analyzes the NetFlows using various\nanomaly detection algorithms, each of which uses a di\ufb00erent set of features. The output are aggregated into\nevents and sent into the trust models. The trust model maps the NetFlows into tra\ufb03c clusters. NetFlows\nwith similar behavioural patterns are clustered together. The aggregator layer creates the composite output\nthat integrates the individual opinion of several anomaly detectors.\n2.4.2 MINDS\nThe Minnesota Intrusion Detection System (MINDS) uses a suite of data mining techniques to automatically\ndetect attacks (Ertoz et al. 2004). It builds a context information for each evaluated NetFlow using the\nfollowing features: the number of NetFlows from the same source IP address as the evaluated NetFlow, the\nnumber of NetFlows toward the same destination host, the number of NetFlows towards the same destination\nhost from the same source port, and the number of NetFlows from the same source host towards the same\ndestination port.

At each round, the framework suggests\nthe training data to clean that minimizes the conditional entropy of possible worlds over the partially clean\ndataset. Once a training data sample is cleaned, it is replaced by its cleaned-up version in all possible worlds.\nAt its core, it uses a sequential information-maximization algorithm that \ufb01nds an approximate solution (to this\nNP-Hard problem) with theoretical guarantees [23]. Calculating such an entropy is often dif\ufb01cult, whereas in\nCPClean we provide ef\ufb01cient algorithms which can calculate this term in polynomial time for a speci\ufb01c family\nof classi\ufb01ers, namely k-nearest-neighbour classi\ufb01ers (kNN).\nThis notion of learning over incomplete data using certain predictions is inspired by research on certain\nanswers over incomplete data [1, 5, 49]. In a nutshell, the latter reasons about certainty orconsistency of the\nanswer to a given input, which consists of a query and an incomplete dataset, by enumerating the results over all\npossible worlds. Extending this view of data incompleteness to non-relational operator (e.g., an ML model) is a\nnatural yet non-trivial endeavor, and Figure 1 illustrates the connection.\nLimitations Taking the downstream ML model into account for prioritizing human cleaning effort is not new.\nActiveClean [27] suggests to use information about the gradient of a \ufb01xed model to solve this task. Alternatively,\nour framework relies on consistent predictions and, thus, works on an unlabeled validation set and on ML\nmodels that are not differentiable. In [23] we use kNN as a proxy to an arbitrary classi\ufb01er, given its ef\ufb01cient\nimplementation despite exponentially many possible worlds. However, it still remains to be seen how to extend",

DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION\nMethods in the \ufb01eld of supervised learning enabled several ap-\nplications for precision farming (Yang et al., 2019; Waldner and\nDiakogiannis, 2019; Mazzia et al., 2019). However, supervised\nlearning is in general associated with a large effort since labeled\ndata are required. So far, few experiments were performed with\nSSL for precision agriculture. In our work, we explored the po-\ntential to use SSL for domain adaptation in crop classi\ufb01cation.\nSupervised learning achieved very good results through noise",

Up to now, the main focus was on the enlargement of data which\nwere evaluated by means of supervised learning methods. Nevertheless, the need for labels is also a limiting and time-consuming\nfactor, while in contrast, ongoing technological development is already providing an ever-increasing amount of unlabeled data.\nSelf-supervised learning (SSL) could overcome this limitation and incorporate existing unlabeled data. Therefore, a crop type data\nset was utilized to conduct experiments with SSL and compare it to supervised methods. A unique feature of our data set from 2016\nto 2018 was a divergent climatological condition in 2018 that reduced yields and affected the spectral \ufb01ngerprint of the plants. Our\nexperiments focused on predicting 2018 using SLL without or a few labels to clarify whether new labels should be collected for\nan unknown year. Despite these challenging conditions, the results showed that SSL contributed to higher accuracies. We believe\nthat the results will encourage further improvements in the \ufb01eld of precision farming, why the SSL framework and data will be\npublished (Marszalek, 2021).\n1. INTRODUCTION",
      "SSL for precision agriculture. In our work, we explored the po-\ntential to use SSL for domain adaptation in crop classi\ufb01cation.\nSupervised learning achieved very good results through noise\nremoval when trained on bands B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B8A, B9,\nB11 and B12. Excluding samples from the target year, an over-\nall accuracy of 0.86 was achieved. This resulted in a decrease of\nabout 8% compared to the test with all the data. We hypothes-\nise that the difference is mainly due to climatological variations\n(Marszalek et al., 2022). The transformer had dif\ufb01culties with\nnoise caused by clouds and improved signi\ufb01cantly with the re-\nduction of bands and noisy time steps. RF showed robust per-\nformance in all tests regardless of noise.\nContrastive pre-training was used to learn robust represent-\nations for each crop type. Augmentation is an important part\nof SSL and crucial for performance. The introduction of 5%\nsamples from the target year improved accuracies and outper-\nformed results using supervised learning. While previous at-\ntempts were mainly based on typical augmentations such as ro-\ntation or jitter (G \u00a8uldenring and Nalpantidis, 2021; Chen and\nHe, 2021), we took a different approach with Aug1. Learning\na crop-invariant representation separated most crop types in the\nembedding space. Only winter wheat and winter barley were\nnot separable. By directly evaluating the backbone, we showed\nthat these two crop types could not be well distinguished by the\ncontrastive embeddings. Therefore, we hypothesise that this is\nthe reason why pre-training combined with \ufb01ne-tuning led to\nslightly worse results than supervised training in some cases.\nWith 10% samples we recommend to proceed supervised be-\ncause here already OA values of around 0.9 were achieved.\nAug3 has proven itself in the test with the noise caused by\nclouds. Here, a signi\ufb01cant increase in accuracy was achieved.\nSuccessful denoising has also been con\ufb01rmed in previous stud-",

      "7 Moving Forward\nWe have brie\ufb02y described four of our previous works with a uni\ufb01ed theme \u2014 all of them provide, in our opinion,\nfunctionalities that are useful to facilitate a better MLOps process , which, on the \ufb02ip side, introduce new funda-\nmental technical problems that require us to jointly analyze the impact of data quality issues to downstream ML\nprocesses. When studying these technical problems, we often need to go beyond an ML-agnostic view of data\nquality and, instead, need to develop new methods that simultaneously combine the two aspects of ML anddata\nquality. Despite the progress that we have made so far, this endeavor is still at its early stages. In the following,\nwe present two future directions that, in our opinion, are necessary to facilitate both MLOps as an important\nfunctionality and ML-aware data quality as a fundamental research area.\nML-Aware Data Quality From a technical perspective, jointly understanding data quality and downstream\nML processes is both interesting and challenging. All results we discussed in this paper are arguably limited [21,\n23, 31, 32] \u2014 after starting from a principled formulation of a problem, reaching fundamental computational\nchallenges within these principled frameworks is inevitable. We get around those by either (1) opting for simpler\nproxy models for which we can derive stronger results and/or more ef\ufb01cient algorithms (e.g., kNN used in\nease.ml/snoopy [32] and CPClean [23]) or (2) optimizing for speci\ufb01c cases commonly used in practice\n(e.g., the patterns in ease.ml/ci [31] that we optimized for). To further facilitate MLOps in general, we are\nin dire need for an ML-aware data quality that is not only principled, but also practical for a larger collection\nof scenarios and ML models. These are all technically challenging \u2014 simply extending the methods that we\ndeveloped is unlikely to succeed. We hope that our current endeavors [21, 23, 31, 32] can serve, in some ways,",

Marszalek1\u2217, Bertrand Le Saux1, Pierre-Philippe Mathieu1, Artur Nowakowski2, Daniel Springer3\n1European Space Agency (ESA) \u03a6-lab, Frascati, Italy -\n(Michael.Marszalek, Bertrand.Le.Saux, Pierre.Philippe.Mathieu)@esa.int\n2World Food Programme (WFP), Rome, Italy - artur.nowakowski@wfp.org\n3Institute of Advanced Research in Arti\ufb01cial Intelligence (IARAI), Vienna, Austria - daniel.springer@iarai.ac.at\nKEY WORDS: Crop types, Self-Supervised Learning, Transformer, Random Forest, SimSiam, Remote Sensing\nABSTRACT:\nMachine learning, satellites or local sensors are key factors for a sustainable and resource-saving optimisation of agriculture and\nproved its values for the management of agricultural land. Up to now, the main focus was on the enlargement of data which\nwere evaluated by means of supervised learning methods. Nevertheless, the need for labels is also a limiting and time-consuming\nfactor, while in contrast, ongoing technological development is already providing an ever-increasing amount of unlabeled data.\nSelf-supervised learning (SSL) could overcome this limitation and incorporate existing unlabeled data. Therefore, a crop type data\nset was utilized to conduct experiments with SSL and compare it to supervised methods. A unique feature of our data set from 2016\nto 2018 was a divergent climatological condition in 2018 that reduced yields and affected the spectral \ufb01ngerprint of the plants. Our\nexperiments focused on predicting 2018 using SLL without or a few labels to clarify whether new labels should be collected for\nan unknown year. Despite these challenging conditions, the results showed that SSL contributed to higher accuracies. We believe\nthat the results will encourage further improvements in the \ufb01eld of precision farming, why the SSL framework and data will be\npublished (Marszalek, 2021).\n1. INTRODUCTION",
      "also be invariant to regional differences. For example, Nyborg\net al. (2021) introduced the temporal shift of crop time series\nin different regions which inspired us to use a drift (Aug2) as\naugmentation. However, this was only partially successful in\nlearning a shift-invariant representation. Further experiments\nwill be necessary to \ufb01nd a domain-invariant representation for\ncrop types. We also plan to further develop SimSiam based\non the lessons learned to more ef\ufb01ciently incorporate unlabeled\ndata into training, which could be important for domain adap-\ntion without labels. Dwibedi et al. (2021) and Zell et al. (2022)\ncon\ufb01rmed that incorporation of unlabeled data improved SSL.\nThesuitability of SSL was considered for crop classi\ufb01cation in\nthis study. We showed that it is essential to introduce few labels\nfor a new year. Although the prediction of crop types in a de-\nviating year was possible, we would like to emphasise that the\ncollection of few samples improved the accuracy and reduced\nuncertainties. The study targeted crop classi\ufb01cation, but we also\nsee potential for other applications in precision agriculture (e.g.\nyield prediction). We showed that the pre-training improved the\nresults and that a costly collection of labels for a region with\nalready existing data from previous years is only partly neces-\nsary. Originally, we assumed that the in\ufb02uence of climatolo-\ngical conditions would be much more signi\ufb01cant. Nevertheless,\nsupervised learning and SSL provided good results. Although\ne.g. a pronounced drought could strongly in\ufb02uence the spectral\nresponse of plants, one can question the in\ufb02uence of climate\nfor the classi\ufb01cation of crops in this study. The advantage of\nthis test was that we used data from one region and thus min-\nimised the in\ufb02uence of soil and fertilisation. We assumed that\nfarming practices were similar over the years. However, for a\nchange of the target region, these two factors need to be taken"

These data were also removed in the pre-\nprocessing, which is why slightly fewer samples are available\nfor 2016.\n2.3 Methods\nRandom Forest (RF) (Biau and Scornet, 2015) and a trans-\nformer (TF) (Vaswani et al., 2017) were used for the supervised\ncrop type classi\ufb01cation task in this study. Overall Accuracy\n(OA) was used as a measure to evaluate the experiments.\nThe semi-supervised crop type classi\ufb01cation follows a two-fold\ntraining regime. In the initial phase (pre-training) a SimSiam ar-\nchitecture with a transformer as encoder (backbone) is trained\nto minimise a contrastive loss between augmented sample pairs\nx1andx2of the same crop type and to maximise the loss\nbetween pairs of different crop types. The latent representation\nencoded by the transformer backbone is then used in a super-\nvised classi\ufb01cation task (\ufb01ne-tuning). Here, a linear layer was\nadded as a classi\ufb01cation head on the pre-trained backbone. The\nSimSiam implementation is based on the original work (Chen\nand He, 2021). We conducted experiments without and with a\nfew labels of the target year. An important aspect was to verify\nthat the embeddings did not collapse during pre-training. Chen\nand He (2021) suggested that the l2-normalized outputs during\ntraining should be close to 1/\u221a\ndim, where dim is the output\ndimension.\n3. EXPERIMENTS\n3.1 Supervised\nThe supervised training for RF and the TF was performed in\nfour different scenarios, distinguishable by the data used fortraining and testing. In the \ufb01rst run the entire data (2016-\n2018) was used in the train (75%) and test (25%) split (E1).\nThe second training was performed with data from 2016 and\n2017 only (E2), while data from 2018 was only used in the test\nset. The training data of the third (E3) and fourth experiment\n(E4) is again based on the years 2016 and 2017 but was en-\nriched with 5% and 10% of samples from 2018 respectively.\nThe \ufb01rst experiment was expected to outperform the other three",

The core idea was\nto mask a part of the input instead of using augmentations such\nas rotation or color distortion which are only suitable for certain\n\u2217Corresponding authoruse cases. The increasing number of self-supervised learning\nmethods differ mainly in terms of loss function, augmentation\nor architecture, with the choice of the underlying encoder play-\ning an important role. In this work, we used a transformer (TF)\nas an encoder, which was veri\ufb01ed in previous studies in a su-\npervised manner (Ru\u00dfwurm et al., 2020). SimCLR was one of\nthe \ufb01rst architectures proposed where augmentation and the use\nof positive and negative pairs is an important property. Another\nsimilar example is MOCO which uses a memory bank in ad-\ndition to negative and positive pairs. An overview as well as\ncomparison of these siamese networks was presented in (Chen\nand He, 2021). We build on the recent SimSiam method, which\ncombines a dual-stream siamese network with various data aug-\nmentations on positive pairs of input data (Chen and He, 2021).\nSimSiam also achieved promising results with a small batch\nsize and a small number of epochs.\nSelf-supervised learning has rarely been used in precision agri-\nculture although it could make an important contribution. For\ninstance, for \ufb01eld-level yield prediction, there are typically very\nfew labels available, which is a limitation for most supervised\nlearning methods. In addition, adapting to a new region or a\nyear with different climatic conditions reduces the effort re-\nquired to record new labels. In fact, plant morphology varies in\ndifferent climates, and plant growth and spectral response may\nchange from year to year, due to climatic variations or agricul-\ntural practices. Models trained on speci\ufb01c imagery and crop\ntype may therefore not transfer optimally to new regions or fu-\nture years (Belgiu and Csillik, 2018). From a machine learn-",

      "also be invariant to regional differences. For example, Nyborg\net al. (2021) introduced the temporal shift of crop time series\nin different regions which inspired us to use a drift (Aug2) as\naugmentation. However, this was only partially successful in\nlearning a shift-invariant representation. Further experiments\nwill be necessary to \ufb01nd a domain-invariant representation for\ncrop types. We also plan to further develop SimSiam based\non the lessons learned to more ef\ufb01ciently incorporate unlabeled\ndata into training, which could be important for domain adap-\ntion without labels. Dwibedi et al. (2021) and Zell et al. (2022)\ncon\ufb01rmed that incorporation of unlabeled data improved SSL.\nThesuitability of SSL was considered for crop classi\ufb01cation in\nthis study. We showed that it is essential to introduce few labels\nfor a new year. Although the prediction of crop types in a de-\nviating year was possible, we would like to emphasise that the\ncollection of few samples improved the accuracy and reduced\nuncertainties. The study targeted crop classi\ufb01cation, but we also\nsee potential for other applications in precision agriculture (e.g.\nyield prediction). We showed that the pre-training improved the\nresults and that a costly collection of labels for a region with\nalready existing data from previous years is only partly neces-\nsary. Originally, we assumed that the in\ufb02uence of climatolo-\ngical conditions would be much more signi\ufb01cant. Nevertheless,\nsupervised learning and SSL provided good results. Although\ne.g. a pronounced drought could strongly in\ufb02uence the spectral\nresponse of plants, one can question the in\ufb02uence of climate\nfor the classi\ufb01cation of crops in this study. The advantage of\nthis test was that we used data from one region and thus min-\nimised the in\ufb02uence of soil and fertilisation. We assumed that\nfarming practices were similar over the years. However, for a\nchange of the target region, these two factors need to be taken",
      "that the results will encourage further improvements in the \ufb01eld of precision farming, why the SSL framework and data will be\npublished (Marszalek, 2021).\n1. INTRODUCTION\nFood sustainability is one of the grand challenges of the next\ndecades, and a rigorous monitoring of the global food system is\nneeded to allocate our resources (Fanzo et al., 2021). In par-\nticular, cropland use monitoring is essential, to assess the sup-\nply chain, but also evaluate the impact on natural ecosystems\nand keep track of the related hidden costs and subsidies (Rock-\nstr\u00a8om et al., 2020). Earth Observation (EO) is a global recurring\nproxy for land use monitoring, which is why it is widely used\nespecially in areas where accessibility and infrastructure are a\nproblem.\nToday\u2019s opportunity is that there is much more image data avail-\nable for feature extraction, even if not labeled. In recent years,\nnew methods such as self-supervision have emerged that allow\nsolid representations to be extracted in an unsupervised manner\nand could provide a more reliable representation for crop type\nmapping or other precision farming applications. Contrastive\nlearning is a powerful approach to self-supervision, which aims\nto learn a representation where similar pairs of samples, such\nas time series of one crop type, are close to each other in the\nembedding space and different time series are far apart. In ad-\ndition, only a few available labels do not impose a restriction as\nwith supervised learning. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) was\nsuccessfully applied to detect changes (Leenstra et al., 2020),\nusing techniques such as pretext tasks or augmentations to learn\nan invariant representation (G \u00a8uldenring and Nalpantidis, 2021).\nBaevski et al. (2022) applied self-supervision for several tasks\n(NLP, speech, computer vision) with the objective to apply one\naugmentation suitable for different domains. The core idea was\nto mask a part of the input instead of using augmentations such",

B) shows the result after pre-training with SimSiam and Aug1. Here it is already possible\nto differ between clusters. C) shows the last step and the embeddings after \ufb01ne-tuning with labels.\nFigure 4.

Crop type resolved accuracy of contrastive\nclassi\ufb01cation based on 11 time steps for E1 and E2.\ncrop type 2 (winter barley), which was more pronounced in\nE2. Since the evaluation for E1 is based on data that included\nsamples in training, a decline in a single crop type may indic-\nate a systematic problem either in the framework or in the data\nthemselves. It is hence of interest to resolve the actual predic-\ntions when the network is confronted with samples of crop type\n2 from the year 2018 (Table 8).\nP(c2)c1c2c3c3c5c6\nE1 084 1 5 10 0\nE2 153 2 3 41 0\nTable 8.

This sug-\ngested that crop type 2 and 5 cannot be suf\ufb01ciently separated\nby the contrastive framework.4. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION\nMethods in the \ufb01eld of supervised learning enabled several ap-\nplications for precision farming (Yang et al., 2019; Waldner and\nDiakogiannis, 2019; Mazzia et al., 2019). However, supervised\nlearning is in general associated with a large effort since labeled\ndata are required. So far, few experiments were performed with\nSSL for precision agriculture. In our work, we explored the po-\ntential to use SSL for domain adaptation in crop classi\ufb01cation.\nSupervised learning achieved very good results through noise",

Up to now, the main focus was on the enlargement of data which\nwere evaluated by means of supervised learning methods. Nevertheless, the need for labels is also a limiting and time-consuming\nfactor, while in contrast, ongoing technological development is already providing an ever-increasing amount of unlabeled data.\nSelf-supervised learning (SSL) could overcome this limitation and incorporate existing unlabeled data. Therefore, a crop type data\nset was utilized to conduct experiments with SSL and compare it to supervised methods. A unique feature of our data set from 2016\nto 2018 was a divergent climatological condition in 2018 that reduced yields and affected the spectral \ufb01ngerprint of the plants. Our\nexperiments focused on predicting 2018 using SLL without or a few labels to clarify whether new labels should be collected for\nan unknown year. Despite these challenging conditions, the results showed that SSL contributed to higher accuracies. We believe\nthat the results will encourage further improvements in the \ufb01eld of precision farming, why the SSL framework and data will be\npublished (Marszalek, 2021).\n1. INTRODUCTION"

    "Anomaly detection in cybersecurity involves creating models of expected behavior within a network and comparing this with actual traffic to identify discrepancies that may indicate potential attacks. \n\nFor instance, the CAMNEP (Cooperative Adaptive Mechanism for Network Protection) system employs anomaly detection models that analyze network traffic through multiple layers. It includes:\n\n1. **Anomaly Detectors**: These use various algorithms and different feature sets to analyze network flows (NetFlows) and detect anomalies.\n2. **Trust Models**: This layer maps NetFlows into clusters based on similar behavioral patterns, helping to organize the data for further analysis.\n3. **Anomaly Aggregators**: They compile outputs from the anomaly detectors, integrating individual opinions to produce a comprehensive assessment of the network traffic.\n\nSimilarly, the MINDS (Minnesota Intrusion Detection System) utilizes data mining techniques to build context information for each NetFlow, assessing factors like the number of flows from the same source IP or towards a specific destination host to derive an anomaly value based on its distance from normal behavior.\n\nIn the case of the Xu algorithm, it focuses on classifying traffic into normal and anomalous flows by evaluating all NetFlows from the same source IP and applying classification rules.\n\nOverall, these systems aim to detect potential threats by identifying deviations from established norms within network traffic.",
