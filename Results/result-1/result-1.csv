2,How machine learning used to detect cyber attack?,"['2.2.1 Machine Learning for Botnet Detection\nThe application of Machine Learning for botnet detection has been widely researched. Stevanovic and Ped-\nersen 2014 developed a ﬂow-based botnet detection system using supervised machine learning. Santana,\nSuthaharan, and Mohanty 2018 explored a couple of Machine Learning models to characterize their capabil-\nities, performance and limitations for botnet attacks.\nMachine learning has also been seen as a solution for evaluating NetFlows or IP-related data, where the\nmain issue would be selecting parameters that could achieve high quality of results (Wagner, Francois, Engel,\net al. 2011).\n2.3 Machine Learning Methods\nSeveral papers on NetFlow-based detection have used a number of Machine Learning techniques. Kozik,\nPawlicki, and Michal 2018 presented distributed ELM, Random Forest, and Gradient-Boosted Trees as cost-\nsensitive approaches for Cybersecurity. In Fruehwirt, Schrittwieser, and Weippl 2014, these approaches are\nused to gain better results and ﬂexibility. A technique called classiﬁcation voting, based on decision trees\nand NaiveBayes, was used because it was shown to achieve high accuracy. Hou et al. 2018 investigated\nDDoS tools using C.45 decision tree, Adaboost, and Random Forest algorithms. Stevanovic and Pedersen\n2014 analyzed and compared Random Forest and Multi-Layer Perceptron. In Wagner, Francois, Engel, et\nal. 2011, the authors used Support Vector Machines (SVM) to detect and classify benign traﬃc from attacks.\nSome of the common Machine Learning methods are described below.\n6'
 '3.Feature Selection This step is required to select features from the extracted ones. It involves the use\nof feature selection techniques to reduce the dimension of the input training matrix. Filtering features\nthrough Pearson Correlation, wrapper methods using Backward Feature Elimination, embedded meth-\nods within the Random Forest Classiﬁer, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and the t-distributed\nStochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) are the diﬀerent techniques used for this purpose.\n4.Comparison of Algorithms We wanted to compare ﬁve chosen algorithms. The various Machine\nLearning Models to be trained in this step are: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM),\nRandom Forest Classiﬁer, Gradient Boosting, and Dense Neural Network.\n5.Botnet Detection The last step in our methodology involves testing our model to see if it can\nsuccessfullydetectbotnettraﬃcfromtheCTU-13dataset. Theoverallperformanceofbotnetdetection\nis determined from the f1score of the aforementioned models.\n3.3 Main issue with Network Security Data\nWorking with Network Security Data brings lots of challenges. First, the data are very imbalance because\nmost of the traﬃc is harmless and only a tiny part of it is malicious. That causes the model to diﬃcultly learn\nwhat is harmful. Moreover, the risk of overﬁtting during the training process is high because the structure\nof the network inﬂuences the way the model learns while a network-independent algorithm is wanted.\nFurthermore, traﬃc analysis deals with a network which is a dynamic structure: communications are\ntime dependent and links between servers may appear and disappear with new requests and new users in\nthe network. That is why detecting new unknown botnets is a real challenge in network security.\nTo cope with all these challenges, an accurate data analysis is needed and mechanisms to prevent over-\nﬁtting like cross-validation are necessary.\n12'
 'through Clustering and has been applied to exploratory analysis and dimension reduction. Both of these\napproaches can be applied in Cybersecurity for analysing malware in near real-time, thus eliminating the\nweaknesses of traditional detection methods.\nOur approach uses NetFlow data for analysis. NetFlow records provide enough information to uniquely\nidentify traﬃc using attributes such as 5-tuples and other ﬁelds, but do not expose private or personally-\nidentiﬁable information (PII). NetFlow, along with its open standard version IPFIX, is already widely used\nfor network monitoring and management. Availability of NetFlow data along with the privacy features makes\nit an eﬃcient choice.\nThis paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we review and present some Related Work where we\ndiscuss relevant topics on NetFlow, Machine Learning, Detection and Clustering Methods.

In Section 4, we present the detail of our Data\nAnalysis, explaining the chosen dataset and the steps involved in feature extraction and feature selection.\nWe then present the Results in Section 5, including the metrics and algorithms used.

Network\ndevices (routers and switches) can be used to collect IP traﬃc information on any of its interfaces where\nNetFlow is enabled. This information, known as Traﬃc Flows, is then collected and analyzed by a central\ncollector.\nNetFlow has since become an industry standard (Claise 2013) for capturing session data.

The\nterm itself is borrowed from Statistics. At the core of the method, it uses logistic functions, a sigmoid curve\nthat is useful for a range of ﬁelds including neural networks. Logistic regression models the probability for\nclassiﬁcation problems with two possible outcomes.

There are three broad categories of anomaly de-\ntection: unsupervised, supervised, and semi-supervised. Some of the popular detection techniques include\ndensity-based k-nearest neighbour, one-class SVM, Bayesian Networks, Cluster-analysis-based outlier detec-\ntion among others.

 '6 Conclusion\nTo conclude, our project aimed at building and comparing models that are able to detect botnets in a real\nnetwork traﬃc represented by Netﬂow datasets.\nAfter a strong analysis of the data and a lot of reviews of network security papers, relevant features were\nextracted. Their inﬂuence were then studied through a selection process but no feature was poor enough to\nbe left aside for the training part.\nThen, diﬀerent algorithms were tested among which a Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine,\nRandom Forest, Gradient Boosting and a Dense Neural Network. The Random Forest Classiﬁer was chosen\nto detect botnets in all the other scenarios, resulting in an detection accuracy of more than 95% of the\nbotnets for 8 out of 13 scenarios.\nAfter that, our group focused on increasing the accuracy for the 5 most diﬃcult scenarios. The use\nof a bootstrap method to increase the amount of data has resulted in detecting more than 55% of the\nscenarios 5, 7 and 11. Only the scores of the scenarios 4 and 12 were diﬃcult to improve ( f1score of 0.75for\nscenario 4 and 0.54for scenario 12). This is perhaps due to a bad representation of the botnet behaviours\nwith the extracted features or more complex algorithms need to be used (like recursive deep neural networks).\nThe possible improvement of the work presented here would be to try to modify the extracted features\nwith diﬀerent widths and strides for the time window and explore more hyperparameters for the diﬃcult\nscenarios. Another idea would be to try to train and test several scenarios at the same time. Finally,\nunsupervised learning can be tested to detect the behaviour of botnets without using the labels of the data.\n43']","Machine learning is used to detect cyber attacks by analyzing network traffic patterns, identifying anomalies, predicting potential threats based on historical data, and automating threat detection and response processes.",0.99999999998,1.0

The\nrecent COVID-19 pandemic, Russia-Ukraine war and riots\nin France (Nahel Merzouk riots) [3] has underscored this\ninterdependence, leading to heightened volatility.\nEvents of social unrest play a vital role in forecasting\nthe dynamics of financial markets during times of geopo-\nlitical unrest. This is primarily because market movements\nare reactionary and anticipatory.

Understanding this dual nature of\nmarket responses—reactive to present situations and potential\ndevelopments—is essential for accurately predicting market\ntrends in such volatile periods.
